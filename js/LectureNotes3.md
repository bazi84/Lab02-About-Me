  ## display: inline
  ## display: inline-block
  ## display: block

    display inline puts an element 'inlne' with ohter elements around it. and it won't have any heights and width properties will have no effect

    display inline-block similar to inline display except with the inline block you can apply and change the height and width. 

    display block, starts on a new line and takes 100% the width of the webpage 

  ## Positioning 2 main types
      - static type
      - relative type
          - relative
          - absollute
          - fixed
      static is a standard, where the element would normally fit on the screen

      position relative element can be moved out of their normal flow position while still taking up the same space. 

      position absolute is similar to position relative with two key difference: the element is taken out of normal flow and leaves no space behind and it's positioned relative to its nearest parent with a relative-type.

      position fixed is the same as absolute with one key difference' the element is postioned relatives to the vewport

  ## Funtion
      - new datatype
      - a group of statements that perform a task or calculate a value, stored within a structure that prevents them from occuring until the function is called aka invoked.

  ## Why?
      - functions are resuable 
      - make code dry
      - prevent bugs
